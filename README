This library provides support for the Pulse-Eight USB-CEC adapter.

                                === Linux ===
===============================================================================

libCEC needs the following dependencies in order to work correctly:
* udev v151 or later
* cdc-acm support compiled into the kernel or available as module

To compile libCEC on Linux, you'll need the following dependencies:
* autoconf 2.13 or later
* automake 1.11 or later
* pkg-config
* libtool
* udev development headers v151 or later
* gcc 4.2 or later

To compile, execute the following commands:
# autoreconf -vif
# ./configure --prefix=/usr
# make
# sudo make install

===============================================================================
                                === OS-X ===
===============================================================================

To compile libCEC on OS-X, you'll need the following dependencies:
* autoconf 2.13 or later
* automake 1.11 or later
* pkg-config
* xcode 3.2.6 or later

To compile, execute the following commands (TODO: please verify):
# autoreconf -vif
# ./configure --prefix=/usr
# make
# sudo make install

# Note: You may need to copy pkg.m4 to your m4 sources directory

===============================================================================
                              === Windows ===
===============================================================================

To compile libCEC on Windows, you'll need Visual C++ 2010 or Visual Studio 2010
The installer needs the Windows DDK (Driver Development Kit) and Nullsoft's
NSIS.

To compile LibCecSharp on Windows, you'll need Visual C++ 2008 or Visual Studio
2008, because it is compiled against .NET 2.0.

To compile libCEC, follow these instructions:
* open /project/libcec.sln with Visual C++ 2010 or Visual Studio 2010.
* build the project.

To build an installer on Windows:
* download and install NSIS.
* go to /project and execute create-installer.bat to create the installer.
* the installer is stored as /build/libCEC-installer.exe

You will need both Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 to build the
installer from the command line. To build with Visual C++ 2008 and 2010,
you will need to manually build libcec with Visual C++ 2010 and then
build LibCecSharp.sln with Visual Studio 2008. See create-installer.bat
for the required steps.

                            === Debugging / Testing ===
===============================================================================

We provide a test client, named cec-client, to debug the device.
To check whether the device can be detected, execute the following command:
* cec-client -l

"cec-client -h" shows a list of commands and options that are available.

===============================================================================
                              === Developers ===
===============================================================================

We provide a C, C++ and .NET CLR interface to the adapter.

C++ developers:
* the API can be found in /include/cec.h
* an example implementation can be found in /src/testclient/main.cpp

C developers:
* the API can be found in /include/cecc.h

.NET developers:
* add a reference to LibCecSharp.dll
* an example can be found in \src\CecSharpTester\CecSharpClient.cs
